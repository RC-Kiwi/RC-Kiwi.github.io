            <p>This is an informal blog for matters related to my work and professional interests. This started as an attempt to keep track of the myriad ways to (1) maintain productivity and battle distraction, and (2) improve public communication, two of the biggest challenges that many young professionals face at the beginning of their careers. It will probably turn into something different by the end of the year because that's just how blogs do.
